      "question": "What is the definition of intestinal malrotation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A spectrum of congenital anomalies resulting from incomplete or abnormal rotation and fixation of the embryonic midgut",
        "B": "A condition characterized by inflammation of the intestinal lining",
        "C": "An acquired disorder due to postnatal trauma",
        "D": "A genetic disorder with well-defined molecular pathways"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Intestinal malrotation is defined as a spectrum of congenital anomalies resulting from incomplete or abnormal rotation and fixation of the embryonic midgut during fetal development."

    {
      "question": "What is the primary embryological failure in intestinal malrotation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Failure of normal 270° counterclockwise rotation of the midgut around the superior mesenteric artery",
        "B": "Failure of 180° clockwise rotation during gestation",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The etiology involves failure of the normal 270° counterclockwise rotation of the midgut around the superior mesenteric artery during embryonic development."

        "A": "Formation of Ladd's bands",
        "B": "Development of intestinal polyps",
        "C": "Overgrowth of colonic bacteria",
        "D": "Autoimmune inflammation"

      "question": "A 3-week-old infant presents with sudden-onset bilious vomiting. What is the most appropriate initial management approach?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Assume malrotation with volvulus until proven otherwise and obtain emergent imaging",
        "B": "Start oral rehydration and schedule outpatient follow-up",
        "C": "Administer antiemetics and observe for 24 hours",
        "D": "Obtain routine abdominal X-rays and discharge if normal"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Bilious vomiting in an infant should be considered malrotation with volvulus until proven otherwise, requiring emergent intervention."
