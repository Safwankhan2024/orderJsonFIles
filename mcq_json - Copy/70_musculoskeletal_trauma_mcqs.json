      "question": "Which of the following is a modifiable risk factor for pediatric musculoskeletal trauma?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Age",
        "B": "Genetic syndromes",
        "C": "Lack of protective equipment",
        "D": "Sex"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Modifiable risk factors include lack of protective equipment, such as helmets. AAP recommendations include safety education, such as use of helmets, pads, and supervised play"
    },

      "question": "What is the primary goal in managing pediatric musculoskeletal trauma?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Rapid surgical intervention",
        "B": "Preserving growth and function",
        "C": "Minimizing hospital stay",
        "D": "Avoiding all imaging"
      },

      "question": "What is an indication for surgical management in pediatric musculoskeletal trauma?",
      "options": {
        "A": "All fractures regardless of displacement",
        "B": "Displaced fractures or growth plate injuries (Salter-Harris III-V)",
        "C": "Only open fractures",
        "D": "Fractures in toddlers only"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",

      "question": "What is the typical duration of immobilization for pediatric fractures?",
      "options": {
        "A": "1–2 weeks",
        "B": "2–4 weeks",
        "C": "4–8 weeks",

        "C": "95%",
        "D": "99%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Approximately 95% of pediatric fractures heal without sequelae due to children's robust healing capacity, provided there is appropriate management and no significant physeal involvement."
