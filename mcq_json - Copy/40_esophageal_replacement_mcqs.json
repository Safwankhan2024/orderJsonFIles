        "B": "Chemical injury from caustic ingestion",
        "C": "Chronic inflammation from GERD",
        "D": "Genetic mutation alone"

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "VACTERL association (vertebral, anal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal, limb anomalies) is present in 20-25% of esophageal atresia cases, highlighting the need for systemic evaluation."

        "D": "VACTERL association"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Caustic injury is classified using the Zargar classification based on endoscopic grading. Grade 0 is normal, Grade 1 has edema and erythema, Grade 2 has ulcerations, 2A for superficial and 2B for deep/circumferential, and Grade 3 is with necrosis, 3A for focal and 3B for extensive. Perforation is Grade 4."
