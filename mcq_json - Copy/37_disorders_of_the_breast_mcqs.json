        "D": "Infection of the breast tissue"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Gynecomastia is defined as the benign proliferation of glandular breast tissue in males, resulting from an imbalance between estrogen and androgen activity."

        "D": "Hypogonadism"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Physiologic causes of gynecomastia include neonatal maternal estrogen exposure and pubertal transient imbalance."

        "D": "Sex (exclusively male)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Modifiable risk factors for gynecomastia include obesity, which increases aromatase activity."

      "question": "Which medication is used for medical management of persistent gynecomastia with 60–80% reduction in size?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Letrozole",
        "B": "Tamoxifen",
        "C": "Antibiotics",
        "D": "Corticosteroids"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Selective estrogen receptor modulators like tamoxifen can achieve a 60–80% reduction in size in persistent cases of gynecomastia."

      "question": "What is an indication for surgical management of gynecomastia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Duration less than 6 months",
        "B": "Persistence >2 years",
        "C": "Asymptomatic cases",
        "D": "Grade I enlargement"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Surgical management is indicated for gynecomastia that persists for more than 2 years, causes significant symptoms, or involves grade II–III enlargement."

    {
      "question": "What percentage of pubertal gynecomastia cases resolve spontaneously within 1-2 years?",
      "options": {
        "A": "50%",
        "B": "80%",
        "C": "90%",
        "D": "95%"

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Spontaneous resolution occurs in 90% of pubertal gynecomastia cases within 1-2 years."
    },
    {
  "question": "Which genetic syndrome is most strongly associated with gynecomastia, occurring in up to 80% of affected individuals?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Down syndrome",
    "B": "Klinefelter syndrome",
    "C": "Turner syndrome",
    "D": "Marfan syndrome"
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) is associated with gynecomastia in up to 80% of cases due to testosterone deficiency and relative estrogen excess. Multiple studies show prevalence rates of 35-80% depending on measurement methods. The hormonal imbalance results from primary testicular failure with decreased testosterone and elevated gonadotropins, leading to increased estrogen-to-androgen ratio and breast tissue proliferation."
