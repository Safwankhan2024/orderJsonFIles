      "question": "What is the prevailing theory for the etiology of jejunoileal atresia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Recanalization failure during embryogenesis",
        "B": "Intrauterine vascular accident leading to bowel ischemia",
        "C": "Primary genetic mutation as the sole cause",
        "D": "Maternal infection during pregnancy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The prevailing theory is a vascular accident in utero causing bowel ischemia and resorption, with no strong evidence supporting the recanalization failure theory."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is the strongest association with jejunoileal atresia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Maternal diabetes mellitus",
        "B": "Intrauterine volvulus or vascular compromise",
        "C": "Advanced maternal age (>35 years)",
        "D": "Multiple gestation pregnancy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Intrauterine volvulus or vascular accidents are key etiological factors, leading to bowel ischemia and atresia formation."

      "question": "What genetic mutation is present in 10-15% of cases of meconium ileus?",
      "options": {
        "A": "BRCA1",
        "B": "CFTR",
        "C": "APC",
        "D": "RET"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "CFTR mutations (cystic fibrosis) are present in 10-15% of cases."

    {
  "question": "What percentage of patients with cystic fibrosis (CFTR mutations) develop meconium ileus in the newborn period?",
  "options": {
    "A": "1-5%",
    "B": "10-15%",
    "C": "30-40%",
    "D": "50-60%"
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Approximately 10-15% of newborns with cystic fibrosis (CFTR mutations) present with meconium ileus, which is essentially pathognomonic for cystic fibrosis. Conversely, about 80-90% of all cases of meconium ileus are caused by cystic fibrosis, making CFTR mutation testing essential in any infant with this condition."

      "question": "What is characteristic of the distal segment in jejunoileal atresia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Dilated and hypertrophied",
        "B": "Collapsed, unused microcolon",
        "C": "Normal caliber",
        "D": "Inflamed mucosa"

      "question": "What happens proximal to the obstruction in jejunoileal atresia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Atrophy",
        "B": "Marked dilation and hypertrophy",
        "C": "Normal peristalsis",
        "D": "Increased absorption"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Proximal to the obstruction, there is marked dilation, hypertrophy, and often compromised peristalsis."

    {
      "question": "What prenatal ultrasound finding is commonly associated with jejunoileal atresia in approximately 25-30% of cases?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Oligohydramnios",
        "B": "Polyhydramnios",
        "C": "Placenta previa",
        "D": "Fetal hydrops"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Polyhydramnios occurs due to impaired fetal swallowing and intestinal absorption of amniotic fluid proximal to the atresia."
