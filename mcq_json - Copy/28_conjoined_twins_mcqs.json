      "question": "What is the most accurate definition of conjoined twins?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Dizygotic twins connected at birth due to environmental factors",
        "B": "Monozygotic twins physically connected due to incomplete embryonic separation",
        "C": "A genetic disorder caused by specific mutations leading to twin fusion",
        "D": "An infection-related anomaly in multiple gestations"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Conjoined twins result from incomplete separation of a single fertilized ovum (monozygotic) during embryonic development, typically between days 13-21 post-fertilization."
    },
    {
      "question": "When does the incomplete division leading to conjoined twins typically occur?",
      "options": {
        "A": "During the first week post-fertilization",
        "B": "Between days 13-15 post-fertilization",
        "C": "At the time of birth",
        "D": "In the third trimester of pregnancy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Incomplete division typically occurs between days 13-21 post-fertilization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What percentage of conjoined twins have congenital heart defects?",
      "options": {
        "A": "25%",
        "B": "50%",
        "C": "75%",
        "D": "90%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Approximately 50-75% of conjoined twins have congenital heart defects, with thoracopagus twins having the highest incidence"
    },
    {
      "question": "When is emergency separation of conjoined twins indicated?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Routinely performed immediately after birth",
        "B": "Only for life-threatening conditions in one or both twins",
        "C": "Primarily for cosmetic improvement",
        "D": "When one twin shows significantly slower growth"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Emergency separation is reserved for life-threatening conditions such as intestinal obstruction, cardiac compromise, or sepsis that cannot be managed conservatively."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the approach to medical management of conjoined twins?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Specific drug therapies are routinely used",
        "B": "No specific medical therapies, only supportive care based on organ system involvement",
        "C": "Immediate surgical intervention is always required",
        "D": "Radiation therapy is a standard component"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "There are no specific medical therapies; management involves supportive care based on organ system involvement, including nutritional and respiratory support."
