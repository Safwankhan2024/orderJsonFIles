      "question": "What is the definition of craniosynostosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Delayed fusion of cranial sutures",
        "B": "Premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures",
        "C": "Abnormal brain development without suture involvement",
        "D": "Inflammation of cranial sutures"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Craniosynostosis is defined as the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, leading to abnormal skull shape and potential restriction of brain growth."

      "question": "What head shape is associated with sagittal synostosis on physical examination?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Trigonocephaly",
        "B": "Brachycephaly",
        "C": "Scaphocephaly",
        "D": "Plagiocephaly"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Sagittal synostosis presents with scaphocephaly, characterized by biparietal narrowing and frontal bossing. Trigonocephaly is characterized by a triangular or keel-shaped forehead when viewed from above. Brachycephaly is characterized by a head that is abnormally short from front to back and wide side to side. Plagiocephaly is asymmetrical or lopsided head shape. The head is flattened on one side, and facial features like the ear and forehead on the affected side may be misaligned or displaced"

      "question": "What percentage of craniosynostosis cases develop increased intracranial pressure?",
      "options": {
        "A": "5-10%",
        "B": "14-24%",
        "C": "30-40%",
        "D": "50-60%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Increased intracranial pressure occurs in 14-24% of craniosynostosis cases."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the recurrence risk for non-syndromic craniosynostosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "<2%",
        "B": "5-8%",
        "C": "10-15%",
        "D": "20-25%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The recurrence risk for non-syndromic craniosynostosis is less than 2%."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following conditions is most commonly associated with secondary craniosynostosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hyperthyroidism",
        "B": "Diabetes mellitus",
        "C": "Hyperparathyroidism",
        "D": "Rickets (vitamin D deficiency)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Hyperthyroidism is a metabolic disorder that can cause secondary craniosynostosis due to accelerated bone maturation. In contrast, rickets (vitamin D deficiency) typically leads to delayed bone mineralization and may delay suture closure rather than cause premature fusion."
