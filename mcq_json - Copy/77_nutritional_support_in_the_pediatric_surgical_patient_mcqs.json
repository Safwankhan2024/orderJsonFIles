    {
      "question": "What hormonal response is activated by surgical stress in pediatric patients?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Release of cortisol, catecholamines, and glucagon",
        "B": "Release of insulin only",
        "C": "Decrease in all hormones",
        "D": "Increase in growth hormone alone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Surgical stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system, leading to release of cortisol, catecholamines, and glucagon."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a recognized complication of nutritional deficits in pediatric surgical patients?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Impaired wound healing and increased infection risk",
        "B": "Accelerated postoperative recovery",
        "C": "Reduced need for analgesic medications",
        "D": "Decreased metabolic rate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Complications include impaired wound healing and dehiscence, increased risk of surgical site infections, prolonged ventilator dependence, increased hospital length of stay, and higher mortality."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which laboratory test is used to assess acute changes in nutritional status?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pre-albumin",
        "B": "Hemoglobin",
        "C": "Creatinine",
        "D": "Blood glucose"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Routine investigations include pre-albumin, which has a short half-life and is a good indicator of acute change."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a benefit of early enteral feeding after surgery?",
      "options": {
        "A": "35% reduction in postoperative infections",
        "B": "Increased risk of ileus",
        "C": "Longer hospital stay",
        "D": "Higher mortality"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Early enteral feeding within 24 hours is associated with a 35% reduction in postoperative infections and shorter length of stay."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) in parenteral nutrition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "1.5-3.0 per 1000 catheter-days",
        "B": "10 per 100 catheter-days",
        "C": "0.5 per 1000 catheter-days",
        "D": "5.0 per 100 catheter-days"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "CRBSI rates for pediatric parenteral nutrition are approximately 1.5-3.0 per 1000 catheter-days, though rates can be lower with strict aseptic techniques."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a modern fasting guideline for clear fluids before surgery?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Until 2 hours pre-op",
        "B": "Until 6 hours pre-op",
        "C": "Until 12 hours pre-op",
        "D": "No fasting needed"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Current guidelines permit clear fluids up to 2 hours preoperatively to reduce dehydration and hypoglycemia while minimizing aspiration risk."
    },
    {
  "question": "According to the 2023 ESPEN guidelines on pediatric parenteral nutrition, which approach is recommended to reduce intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) risk?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use of multi-chamber bags and fish-oil containing lipid emulsions",
    "B": "Use of single-chamber bags only",
    "C": "Complete avoidance of lipid emulsions",
    "D": "Increased carbohydrate-to-lipid ratio"
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The 2023 ESPEN guidelines specifically recommend using multi-chamber bags (MCBs) combined with fish-oil containing lipid emulsions (such as SMOFlipid with 15% fish oil) to reduce IFALD risk in pediatric patients requiring parenteral nutrition. This approach provides better fatty acid profiles and has been shown to be safer and more effective than traditional soybean oil-only formulations."
