        "A": "Increased functional residual capacity",
        "B": "Reduced functional residual capacity and increased oxygen consumption",
        "C": "Decreased heart rate",

        "A": "Propofol",

        "C": "Midazolam",

      "question": "Which syndrome is associated with atlantoaxial instability and airway stenosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pierre Robin sequence",
        "B": "Down syndrome",
        "C": "Treacher Collins syndrome",
        "D": "Marfan syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Down syndrome is linked to atlantoaxial instability due to ligamentous laxity and upper airway issues like subglottic stenosis, requiring careful airway management in anesthesia."

      "question": "What is the molecular mechanism of malignant hyperthermia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Uncontrolled calcium release in skeletal muscle",
        "B": "Decreased drug metabolism",
        "C": "Airway obstruction",
        "D": "Hypotension"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Malignant hyperthermia involves uncontrolled calcium release in skeletal muscle via RYR1 mutations."
