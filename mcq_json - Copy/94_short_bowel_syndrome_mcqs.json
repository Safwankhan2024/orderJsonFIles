      "question": "Which of the following is a common symptom of short bowel syndrome in pediatric patients?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Chronic diarrhea (typically 5-15 stools daily)",
        "B": "Severe constipation requiring daily laxatives",
        "C": "Hematemesis with coffee-ground emesis",
        "D": "Polyuria and polydipsia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Chronic diarrhea is a hallmark symptom due to reduced intestinal surface area and malabsorption, often accompanied by failure to thrive and nutrient deficiencies."
    },
    {
      "question": "What percentage of long-term parenteral nutrition patients develop parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease?",
      "options": {
        "A": "40-60%",
        "B": "60-85%",
        "C": "15-20%",
        "D": "30-50%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease affects 40-60% of long-term PN patients."

    {
      "question": "What citrulline level predicts permanent intestinal failure with 85% sensitivity?",
      "options": {
        "A": "<10 μmol/L",
        "B": "<20 μmol/L",
        "C": ">20 μmol/L",
        "D": "<50 μmol/L"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Citrulline levels <20 μmol/L are often used, but <10 μmol/L may have higher specificity for permanent intestinal failure."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the evaluation of a child with short bowel syndrome, which imaging modality is most useful for assessing mucosal detail and intestinal motility?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Abdominal radiography",
        "B": "Contrast studies",
        "C": "Ultrasound",
        "D": "MRI enterography"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "MRI enterography provides excellent mucosal and motility assessment without radiation exposure, making it ideal for serial evaluations in pediatric SBS."

        "B": "60-70%",
        "C": "63%",
        "D": "70-80%"

    {
      "question": "What is the overall survival rate at 5 years for Short Bowel Syndrome patients in specialized centers?",
      "options": {
        "A": "50-70%",
        "B": "60-70%",
        "C": "70-90%",

    {
      "question": "During the intestinal adaptation phase in short bowel syndrome, what histological change is typically observed?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Villous hypertrophy with crypt hyperplasia",
        "B": "Mucosal atrophy and fibrosis",
        "C": "Decreased inflammatory infiltrate",
        "D": "Normal villous architecture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "During adaptation, the intestine shows villous hypertrophy (increased height) and crypt hyperplasia to increase absorptive surface area."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections in Short Bowel Syndrome patients?",
      "options": {
        "A": "2-5 episodes per 1,000 catheter days",
        "B": "5-10%",
        "C": "15-20%",
