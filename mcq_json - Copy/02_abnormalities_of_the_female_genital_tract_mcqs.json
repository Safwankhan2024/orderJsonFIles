      "question": "What is the primary embryologic origin of the hymen?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Forms at the junction of the vaginal plate (from sinovaginal bulbs) and the urogenital sinus",
        "B": "Originates solely from the urogenital sinus",
        "C": "Derives from the mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts",
        "D": "Develops from the cloacal membrane"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The hymen arises where the vaginal plate (a downgrowth from the Müllerian ducts via sinovaginal bulbs) meets the urogenital sinus, forming a thin membrane."

      "question": "What is the long-term prognosis for patients with imperforate hymen after surgical treatment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Excellent, with normal menstrual function, sexual activity, and fertility",
        "B": "Guarded, with high risk of infertility",
        "C": "Poor, requiring lifelong hormonal therapy",
        "D": "Uncertain, with frequent recurrences"
      },
