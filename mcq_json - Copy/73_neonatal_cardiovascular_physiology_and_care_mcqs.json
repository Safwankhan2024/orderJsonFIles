      "question": "What causes cyanosis in Tetralogy of Fallot?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Shunting of oxygenated blood to the lungs",
        "B": "Shunting of deoxygenated blood to the systemic circulation",
        "C": "Increased pulmonary blood flow",
        "D": "Left ventricular failure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Cyanosis results from shunting of deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the systemic circulation via the VSD and overriding aorta."

      "question": "In untreated Tetralogy of Fallot, chronic cyanosis often leads to compensatory polycythemia. What is a potential complication of this condition?",

        "A": "Anemia",
        "B": "Polycythemia",
        "C": "Leukopenia",
        "D": "Thrombocytopenia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Compensatory polycythemia increases blood viscosity, raising the risk of hyperviscosity syndrome, which can cause thrombosis, stroke, or other ischemic events."
