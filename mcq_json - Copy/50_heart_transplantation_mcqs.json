      "options": {
        "A": "Milrinone",
        "B": "Tacrolimus",
        "C": "Mycophenolate",
        "D": "Belatacept"

  "question": "According to recent ISHLT (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation) registry data, which age group has the longest median survival after pediatric heart transplantation?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Infants (<1 year)",
    "B": "Children (1-5 years)",
    "C": "School-age children (6-10 years)",
    "D": "Adolescents (11-17 years)"
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The ISHLT registry demonstrates that infants <1 year old have the longest median survival of 22.3 years, followed by children aged 1-5 years (18.4 years), 6-10 years (14.4 years), and adolescents (13.1 years). This survival advantage is attributed to lower rates of acute rejection, reduced development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and potentially more favorable immune tolerance in this age group."
