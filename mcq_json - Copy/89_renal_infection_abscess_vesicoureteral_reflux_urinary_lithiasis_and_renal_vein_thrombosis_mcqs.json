      "question": "What is the most common bacterial cause of acute pyelonephritis in children?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Escherichia coli",
        "B": "Klebsiella",
        "C": "Proteus",
        "D": "Enterococcus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Escherichia coli accounts for 80–90% of cases of acute pyelonephritis in children."

    {
  "question": "Which urine culture result defines significant bacteriuria that supports a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in a clean-catch specimen?",
  "options": {
    "A": ">10,000 CFU/mL of a single pathogen",
    "B": ">50,000 CFU/mL of a single pathogen",
    "C": "≥100,000 CFU/mL of a single pathogen",
    "D": "Positive nitrites and pyuria alone"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Significant bacteriuria is defined as ≥100,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen in clean-catch specimens per IDSA guidelines. However, acute pyelonephritis is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on systemic signs (fever, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness); urine cultures support but do not alone confirm the diagnosis. The culture is essential for identifying the organism and guiding targeted antibiotic therapy. Lower counts (≥10,000 CFU/mL) may be significant in catheterized specimens or highly symptomatic patients. Option D is suggestive but insufficient for pyelonephritis diagnosis."

      "question": "What imaging study is considered the gold standard for detecting renal parenchymal inflammation and scarring following pyelonephritis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Renal ultrasound",
        "B": "CT scan",
        "C": "DMSA scan",
        "D": "VCUG"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) renal scan is the most sensitive modality for detecting acute inflammation and subsequent renal scarring, typically performed 4-6 months after infection."

      "question": "With appropriate antibiotic treatment initiated promptly, what is the approximate success rate for resolution of uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis in children?",
      "options": {
        "A": "70-80%",
        "B": "85-90%",
        "C": ">95%",
        "D": "100%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "With timely appropriate antibiotic therapy, approximately 85-90% of children with uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis achieve complete resolution without complications."

      "question": "What is a renal abscess?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A bacterial infection of the bladder",

        "C": "A stone in the kidney",
        "D": "A blood clot in the renal vein"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A renal abscess is defined as a localized collection of pus within the renal parenchyma."

      "question": "What is the gold standard imaging for diagnosing a renal abscess?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ultrasound",
        "B": "X-ray",
        "C": "CT with contrast",
        "D": "MRI"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "CT with contrast is the gold standard imaging modality for renal abscess, showing a hypodense lesion with rim enhancement."

        "A": "Forward flow of urine from kidneys to bladder",
        "B": "Retrograde flow of urine from bladder to ureters and kidneys",
        "C": "Blockage in the ureter",
        "D": "Infection in the kidney"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Vesicoureteral reflux is defined as the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to the ureters and kidneys due to an incompetent ureterovesical junction."
