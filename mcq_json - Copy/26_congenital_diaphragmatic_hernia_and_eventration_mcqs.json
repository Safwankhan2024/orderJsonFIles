      "question": "What is diaphragmatic eventration?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A congenital defect with abdominal organ herniation",
        "B": "An abnormal elevation of an intact diaphragm due to muscular thinning or atrophy",
        "C": "A life-threatening anomaly with cardiac dysfunction only",
        "D": "A condition resulting from failed pleuroperitoneal canal closure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Diaphragmatic eventration is characterized by an abnormal elevation of an intact diaphragm resulting from muscular thinning or atrophy. It often presents asymptomatically, unlike CDH which involves a true defect with herniation of abdominal contents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is the most common type of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Morgagni hernia",
        "B": "Bochdalek hernia",
        "C": "Hiatal hernia",
        "D": "Paraesophageal hernia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Bochdalek hernia is the most common type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (85-90% of cases), located posterolaterally. Morgagni hernias are anterior and much rarer. Hiatal and paraesophageal hernias are typically acquired, not congenital."
    },
    {
      "question": "During which weeks of gestation does the failure leading to CDH typically occur?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Weeks 4-6",
        "B": "Weeks 6-8",
        "C": "Weeks 8-10",
        "D": "Weeks 10-12"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "CDH results from failure of pleuroperitoneal canal closure and fold fusion during weeks 8-10 of gestation. This critical period of diaphragm development disruption leads to the characteristic defect."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the most common side for CDH occurrence?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Right-sided",
        "B": "Left-sided",
        "C": "Bilateral",
        "D": "Anterior"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "CDH is usually left-sided (80-85% of cases). Right-sided hernias are less common but often more severe due to liver herniation. Bilateral CDH is extremely rare and usually fatal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary mechanism leading to pulmonary hypoplasia in CDH?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Genetic mutation in lung cells",
        "B": "Physical compression of the developing lungs",
        "C": "Infection during gestation",
        "D": "Maternal malnutrition"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pulmonary hypoplasia in CDH is caused by physical compression of the developing lungs by herniated abdominal contents during critical periods of lung development (pseudoglandular and canalicular phases), reducing airway branching and alveolar development."
    },
    {
      "question": "What histopathological finding is seen in the pulmonary vasculature in CDH?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Medial hypertrophy and adventitial thickening",
        "B": "Alveolar destruction",
        "C": "Bronchial dilation",
        "D": "Inflammatory infiltrates"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The pulmonary vasculature in CDH demonstrates medial hypertrophy and adventitial thickening of small arterioles, contributing to pulmonary hypertension. This structural abnormality, combined with reduced vascular cross-sectional area, creates significant pulmonary vascular reactivity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a common symptom of neonatal CDH?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Recurrent respiratory infections",
        "B": "Respiratory distress immediately after birth",
        "C": "Mild respiratory symptoms",
        "D": "Asymptomatic presentation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Neonatal CDH commonly presents with severe respiratory distress immediately after birth due to pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. Occult or late-presenting CDH can have milder symptoms but is less common."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key feature of CDH on prenatal ultrasound?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cardiac enlargement",
        "B": "Abdominal contents in thoracic cavity",
        "C": "Diaphragmatic thickening",
        "D": "Normal mediastinal position"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Prenatal ultrasound for CDH shows abdominal contents (stomach, intestine, liver) in the thoracic cavity, mediastinal shift away from the side of herniation, and reduced lung-to-head ratio (LHR) which predicts severity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the target pre-ductal SpO2 in medical management of CDH?",
      "options": {
        "A": "70-85%",
        "B": "80-95%",
        "C": "95-100%",
        "D": "100% only"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In CDH management, the target pre-ductal SpO2 is 80-95%. This 'gentle ventilation' strategy avoids hyperoxia and aggressive ventilation that can cause lung injury and worsen pulmonary hypertension through oxidative stress and volutrauma."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which pulmonary vasodilator is standard in medical management of CDH?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO)",
        "B": "Epinephrine",
        "C": "Dopamine",
        "D": "Albuterol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is the standard pulmonary vasodilator for CDH-associated pulmonary hypertension. It improves oxygenation by selectively dilating pulmonary vasculature without systemic hypotension, though its effect on mortality remains debated."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the general principle of CDH management before surgery?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Immediate surgical repair",
        "B": "Gentle ventilation and physiologic stabilization",
        "C": "Aggressive hyperventilation",
        "D": "No intervention until symptoms worsen"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "CDH management follows a paradigm of gentle ventilation and physiologic stabilization (sometimes for days) before surgical repair. This allows pulmonary hypertension to improve and avoids operating on unstable infants, improving outcomes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the recurrence rate for thoracoscopic repair of CDH compared to open repair?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Lower with thoracoscopic repair",
        "B": "Higher with thoracoscopic repair (11.5% vs 4.7%)",
        "C": "Same for both approaches",
        "D": "Not documented"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A systematic review indicated a higher recurrence rate with thoracoscopic repair (11.5%) compared to open repair (4.7%). This may relate to technical difficulty, tension on repair, and learning curve. However, thoracoscopic approach offers benefits of reduced pain and faster recovery."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a common late complication of CDH repair, especially with patch use?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Recurrence of hernia",
        "B": "Acute kidney injury",
        "C": "Hepatic failure",
        "D": "Pancreatitis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Recurrence of hernia is a late complication of CDH repair, with a risk of approximately 10-20% with patch repair versus <5% with primary repair. Patch use, while necessary for large defects, increases recurrence risk due to material failure or disruption."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which complication occurs in more than 50% of CDH survivors?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sensorineural hearing loss",
        "B": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)",
        "C": "Neurodevelopmental delay",
        "D": "Chronic lung disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs in 50-80% of CDH survivors due to altered anatomy, increased abdominal pressure, and esophageal dysmotility. Most require medical management, and many need fundoplication for severe reflux."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in CDH cases?",
      "options": {
        "A": "20-30%",
        "B": "30-40%",
        "C": "40-50%",
        "D": "50-60%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Pulmonary hypertension occurs in 50-60% of CDH cases, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality. It results from both structural vascular abnormalities (reduced cross-sectional area, medial hypertrophy) and functional vasoconstriction."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the survival rate for CDH patients without ECMO?",
      "options": {
        "A": "70-80%",
        "B": "75-85%",
        "C": "80-90%",
        "D": "85-90%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Survival without ECMO is 85-90% for CDH patients who don't require it (milder disease). Overall survival for all CDH patients is approximately 65-75% in modern series. ECMO is reserved for severe pulmonary hypertension refractory to medical management, with survival of 50-60%."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which investigational fetal therapy is used for severe left-sided CDH?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Amniocentesis",
        "B": "Fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO)",
        "C": "Placental transfusion",
        "D": "Umbilical cord ligation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) is an investigational fetal therapy for severe left-sided CDH. It aims to promote lung growth by occluding the trachea, causing fluid accumulation and airway stretch. Randomized trials show improved survival but increased prematurity risk."
