        "C": "Inflammation only in the small intestine",
        "D": "Autoimmune disorder without genetic predisposition"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Crohn's disease is characterized by discontinuous, segmental inflammation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus."

      "question": "What is the believed etiology of Crohn's disease?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Caused by a single identified pathogen",
        "B": "Result of an aberrant immune response to intestinal microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals",
        "C": "Due solely to dietary factors",
        "D": "Caused by viral infections"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to result from an aberrant immune response to intestinal microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals, with no single pathogen consistently identified."

      "question": "Which non-invasive laboratory test has the highest sensitivity for detecting active intestinal inflammation in pediatric Crohn's disease?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)",
        "B": "C-reactive protein (CRP)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Fecal calprotectin >100 μg/g has a sensitivity of 85-90% for detecting mucosal inflammation and is preferred as a non-invasive marker over serologic tests like ASCA."
