        "D": "Incision and Drainage"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Excisional biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing lymphoma, with a diagnostic accuracy of over 98%, as it preserves nodal architecture for histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry."
