        "D": "DMSA scan"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Urodynamic studies are the gold standard for diagnosis and risk stratification, as they measure detrusor pressure, compliance, capacity, and identify detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia."

    {
      "question": "What is the cornerstone of medical management for neurogenic bladder?",
      "options": {
