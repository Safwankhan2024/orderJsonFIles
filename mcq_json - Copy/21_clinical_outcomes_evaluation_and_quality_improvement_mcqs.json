      "question": "What is the primary focus of Clinical Outcomes Evaluation and Quality Improvement in pediatric surgery?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To assess individual surgeon performance in isolation",
        "B": "To enhance system-wide performance through continuous collection and analysis of risk-adjusted clinical data",
        "C": "To reduce the overall number of surgical procedures performed",
        "D": "To focus exclusively on preoperative optimization"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Quality improvement in pediatric surgery emphasizes system-wide performance enhancement rather than individual assessment, utilizing continuous data collection and risk adjustment to drive improvements."

      "options": {
        "A": "Increased opioid use.",
        "B": "A 20-30% reduction in length of stay and opioid use without increasing complications.",
        "C": "Higher readmission rates.",
        "D": "No impact on recovery outcomes."
      },
