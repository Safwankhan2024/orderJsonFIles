      "question": "Which of the following best defines cardiopulmonary failure in pediatric patients?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Inability to maintain adequate gas exchange and systemic perfusion despite maximal support",
        "B": "High cardiac output with preserved oxygenation",
        "C": "Isolated respiratory failure without hemodynamic compromise",
        "D": "Transient hypotension responsive to fluids"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Cardiopulmonary failure is characterized by the inability of the heart and lungs to maintain adequate gas exchange and systemic perfusion."

      "question": "What type of therapy is ECLS for pediatric patients with refractory cardiopulmonary failure?",
      "options": {
        "A": "First-line treatment",
        "B": "Salvage therapy",
        "C": "Preventive measure",
        "D": "Diagnostic procedure"

      "explanation": "ECLS is a salvage therapy for pediatric patients with refractory cardiopulmonary failure unresponsive to conventional management."

      "question": "In the pathogenesis of cardiopulmonary failure, what is typically the initial triggering event?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)",
        "B": "An initial insult such as severe infection or myocardial ischemia",
        "C": "Development of multi-organ dysfunction",
        "D": "Initiation of mechanical ventilation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Cardiopulmonary failure often begins with an acute insult like sepsis or ischemia, which then progresses to hypoxia, acidosis, and systemic compromise."

      "question": "What is the target activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) for anticoagulation during ECLS?",
      "options": {
        "A": "40-60 seconds",
        "B": "60-80 seconds",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Unfractionated heparin is titrated to aPTT 60-80 seconds for anticoagulation."
