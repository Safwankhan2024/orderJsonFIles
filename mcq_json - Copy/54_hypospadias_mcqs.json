      "question": "What are the three characteristic features of hypospadias?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Proximal urethral meatus, ventral chordee, dorsally hooded foreskin",
        "B": "Distal urethral meatus, dorsal chordee, complete prepuce",
        "C": "Ventral urethral meatus, no chordee, normal prepuce",
        "D": "Urethral meatus at glans, ventral curvature, complete prepuce"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Hypospadias is characterized by a proximally displaced urethral meatus on the ventral aspect, ventral curvature of the penis (chordee), and a dorsally hooded, incomplete prepuce."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary etiology of hypospadias?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It is a disorder of androgen-dependent development",
        "B": "It is caused by bacterial infection during gestation",
        "C": "It results from trauma during delivery",
        "D": "It is due to vitamin deficiency in the mother"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Hypospadias is considered a disorder of androgen-dependent development, where insufficient androgen production, action, or timing leads to incomplete fusion of the urethral folds."

        "A": "1-2% risk",

        "C": "20-25% risk",
        "D": "50-60% risk"

      "question": "Which of the following genetic syndromes is most strongly associated with hypospadias?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Down syndrome",
        "B": "WAGR syndrome",
        "C": "Marfan syndrome",
        "D": "Cystic fibrosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, retardation) is strongly associated with hypospadias due to WT1 gene mutations affecting genital development."

      "question": "During which gestational weeks does hypospadias originate?",

        "A": "Weeks 4-6",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Hypospadias originates between gestational weeks 8-14 during urethral formation."

      "question": "Which anomaly is commonly associated with hypospadias?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cryptorchidism",
        "B": "Hypertension",
        "C": "Asthma",
        "D": "Diabetes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Cryptorchidism is present in approximately 9% of hypospadias cases."

      "question": "What is currently considered the gold standard surgical technique for distal hypospadias repair?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bracka two-stage repair",
        "B": "Tubularized Incised Plate (TIP) urethroplasty",
        "C": "Onlay island flap urethroplasty",
        "D": "MAGPI procedure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Tubularized Incised Plate (TIP) urethroplasty (Snodgrass technique) is the gold standard for distal hypospadias due to its excellent cosmetic results and low complication rates."

    {
      "question": "What is the approximate fistula rate for primary distal hypospadias repairs?",
      "options": {
        "A": "1%",
        "B": "4%",
        "C": "10%",
        "D": "20%"

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Meta-analyses show a fistula rate of approximately 4% for primary distal repairs."
