        "D": "After the 20th week"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The etiology of ARM involves a disruption in the complex embryological development of the hindgut, cloaca, and urogenital sinus between the 4th and 8th weeks of gestation. ARM results from the failed descent and separation of the hindgut from the urogenital tract by the urorectal septum."
