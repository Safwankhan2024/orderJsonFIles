      {
      "question": "Which imaging modality remains the definitive 'reference standard' for diagnosing vascular injuries, allowing for simultaneous therapeutic intervention?",
      "options": {
        "A": "CT Angiography",
        "B": "Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)",
        "C": "Duplex Ultrasonography",
        "D": "Conventional Radiography"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "While CTA is the most common first-line test, Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) remains the definitive reference standard. It provides the highest spatial resolution and allows for immediate endovascular intervention (e.g., stenting or embolization)."
      },
      {
      "question": "In pediatric trauma with suspected vascular injury, which imaging modality is most commonly used as the initial diagnostic test due to its high sensitivity and availability?",
      "options": {
        "A": "CT angiography",
        "B": "Duplex ultrasonography",
        "C": "Conventional angiography",
        "D": "Magnetic resonance angiography"
      },
      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "CT angiography is often the initial choice in pediatric trauma for rapid assessment of vascular injuries, with sensitivity >95%, though conventional angiography remains the definitive gold standard in complex cases."

      {
      "question": "For a pediatric patient with acute limb ischemia due to vascular injury, what is the generally recommended maximum time to revascularization to optimize limb salvage?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Within 6 hours",
        "B": "Within 12 hours",
        "C": "Within 24 hours",
        "D": "Within 48 hours"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Revascularization within 6 hours is typically recommended to minimize ischemic damage and improve salvage rates, based on guidelines for acute limb ischemia in pediatric trauma."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a 'hard sign' of vascular injury in pediatric trauma that warrants immediate surgical exploration?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Absent or diminished pulses",
        "B": "Hypertension",
        "C": "Hyperactive reflexes",
        "D": "Jaundice"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Absent or diminished pulses are a hard sign of vascular injury, indicating potential arterial compromise that requires urgent intervention to prevent limb loss. Other signs include active bleeding, expanding hematoma, bruit or thrill over the injury site, and signs of shock such as tachycardia and hypotension."
