      "question": "Which tumor marker is most specifically associated with hepatoblastoma in children?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Beta-HCG",
        "B": "Catecholamines (VMA/HVA)",
        "C": "Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)",
        "D": "Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is elevated in 80-90% of hepatoblastoma cases and serves as both diagnostic and monitoring marker."

      "question": "What is the first-line imaging modality for abdominal masses in children?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Computed Tomography (CT)",
        "B": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)",
        "C": "Ultrasound",
        "D": "FDG-PET/CT"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Ultrasound is first-line for abdominal masses as it characterizes cystic vs. solid components and guides further imaging to plan the biopsy."

      "question": "What factors are used for counselling before the treatment regarding the prognosis in pediatric solid tumors?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Only the type of biopsy performed",
        "B": "Specific tumor type, stage, and molecular profile",
        "C": "Patient's age and gender",
        "D": "The imaging modality used"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pre-treatment counselling for prognosis is entirely dependent on the specific tumor type, stage, and molecular profile obtained from the biopsy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the typical pain management approach after a biopsy procedure?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Opioids as first-line",
        "B": "Acetaminophen and ibuprofen, with opioids reserved",
        "C": "No analgesia needed",
        "D": "Only local anesthetics"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Multimodal analgesia typically includes acetaminophen and ibuprofen, with opioids reserved for severe pain."
    },
    {
    "question": "Why should a biopsy tract be placed in alignment with the anticipated definitive surgical incision?",
      "options": {
      "A": "To reduce procedural time and cost",
      "B": "For improved cosmetic outcome",
      "C": "To allow complete excision during definitive surgery",
      "D": "To minimize postoperative pain"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The biopsy tract must be excised en bloc with the tumor during definitive resection to prevent seeding and local recurrence."
