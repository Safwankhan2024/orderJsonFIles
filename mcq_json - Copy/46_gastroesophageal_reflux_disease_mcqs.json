      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "GERD is defined as a condition in which the retrograde passage of gastric contents into the esophagus causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications, distinct from physiologic gastroesophageal reflux in infants."

        "D": "Allergic reactions to food"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The primary etiology of GERD is the functional or anatomic incompetence of the anti-reflux barrier at the gastroesophageal junction, which includes the lower esophageal sphincter and the crural diaphragm."

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The primary mechanism in most patients is Transient Lower Esophageal Sphincter Relaxations (TLESRs), where the LES inappropriately relaxes without swallowing."

        "B": "Heartburn",
        "C": "Chest pain",
        "D": "Hoarseness"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Common symptoms in infants with GERD include frequent regurgitation/vomiting, irritability, feeding refusal, arching (Sandifer syndrome), and failure to thrive."

    {
      "question": "What is the sensitivity of an Upper GI Series for detecting gastroesophageal reflux?",
      "options": {
        "A": "~31%",
        "B": "~70%",
        "C": "~50%",
        "D": "~90%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "An Upper GI Series has a sensitivity of only approximately 31% and specificity of approximately 80-90% for detecting reflux itself, and it is not used for diagnosing GERD but for ruling out anatomic abnormalities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which condition is a key differential diagnosis for GERD?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)",
        "B": "Appendicitis",
        "C": "Hepatitis",
        "D": "Pancreatitis"
      },

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "For children whose symptoms persist despite first-line lifestyle interventions (thickened feeds, small frequent feeds, head elevation), Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are the recommended initial pharmacologic therapy. A meta-analysis confirms their effectiveness in achieving symptom resolution and healing erosive esophagitis."
