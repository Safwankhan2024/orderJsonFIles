    {
      "question": "Which factor is most strongly associated with the development of choledochal cysts",
      "options": {
        "A": "JAG1 mutations in Alagille syndrome",
        "B": "Anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ)",
        "C": "Genetic mutation in the JAG1 gene",
        "D": "Exposure to environmental toxins"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ) is a major associated factor present in 50-80% of cases, but the exact etiology remains multifactorial with genetic and developmental components"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the pathogenesis sequence of choledochal cysts?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bile stasis → infection → dilation",
        "B": "anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ) → reflux of pancreatic juice → enzymatic digestion → weakness and dilation",
        "C": "Genetic mutation → inflammation → fibrosis",
        "D": "Obstruction → pressure buildup → rupture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "APBJ leads to reflux of pancreatic enzymes in many cases, causing duct wall damage, but pathogenesis may also involve congenital ductal weakness and other factors"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which imaging technique is considered the gold standard for diagnosis and classification of choledochal cysts?",
      "options": {
        "A": "ERCP",
        "B": "MRCP",
        "C": "PET scan",
        "D": "HIDA scan"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "MRCP provides excellent non-invasive visualization of the biliary tree with >95% sensitivity for detecting choledochal cysts and allows accurate Todani classification without radiation exposure."

    {
      "question": "What is the standard surgical technique for choledochal cyst excision?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cholecystectomy",
        "B": "Complete cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy",
        "C": "Endoscopic sphincterotomy",
        "D": "Liver resection"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The standard technique is complete cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key component of postoperative management following choledochal cyst excision with hepaticojejunostomy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Prolonged nil per os (NPO) status for 5-7 days",
        "B": "Early enteral feeding and monitoring for biliary complications",
        "C": "Routine endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) before discharge",
        "D": "Delayed enteral nutrition until bowel function fully returns"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Early enteral feeding promotes recovery while vigilant monitoring for complications like bile leak, anastomotic stricture, or cholangitis is essential in the postoperative period."
