      "question": "Which characteristic is associated with a full-thickness (3rd degree) burn?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Blisters with clear fluid",
        "B": "Moist, pink, blanchable skin",
        "C": "Leathery, dry, insensate skin",
        "D": "Erythema and pain"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Full-thickness burns are characterized by leathery, dry, insensate skin, and may appear charred or pearly white with thrombosed vessels visible."

    {
      "question": "What systemic effect is triggered by a major burn injury?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Decreased metabolic rate",
        "B": "Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)",
        "C": "Improved immune function",
        "D": "Reduced capillary permeability"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The initial local injury triggers a massive systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), leading to capillary leak, hypermetabolism, and immunosuppression."

        "C": "Erythema",
        "D": "Skin sloughing"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Signs of inhalation injury include soot in the nares or oropharynx, singed nasal hairs, hoarseness, and stridor."

        "D": "<2% full thickness"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Major burns in children are defined as >10% TBSA, burns involving critical areas, electrical/chemical/inhalation injuries, and all burns in high-risk patients."

    {
      "question": "How is the Parkland Formula administered for fluid resuscitation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "All fluid given in the first 8 hours",
        "B": "Half given in first 8 hours, remainder over next 16 hours",
        "C": "Given equally over 24 hours",
        "D": "Based on urine output only"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Parkland Formula is 4 mL Lactated Ringer's x %TBSA (2nd & 3rd degree) x kg body weight, with half given in the first 8 hours and the remainder over the next 16 hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "In controlled surgical settings with optimal conditions, what is the approximate rate of skin graft loss following burn reconstruction?",
      "options": {
        "A": "1-2%",
        "B": "5-10%",
        "C": "20-30%",
        "D": "50%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "With meticulous surgical technique and proper postoperative care, graft loss typically occurs in 5-10% of cases, though rates may be higher with infection or poor wound bed preparation."
