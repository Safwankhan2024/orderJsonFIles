      "question": "During which gestational weeks does the critical developmental failure leading to bladder exstrophy typically occur?",
      "options": {
        "A": "4th to 6th week",
        "B": "1st to 3rd week",
        "C": "11th to 15th week",
        "D": "20th to 25th week"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Bladder exstrophy arises from failure of abdominal wall closure during the 4th to 6th week of gestation, when the cloacal membrane ruptures prematurely."

      "question": "For a newborn with classic bladder exstrophy, at what age is primary reconstruction most commonly performed if a delayed approach is chosen?",
      "options": {
        "A": "6-12 months",
        "B": "1-2 years",
        "C": "3-4 years",
        "D": "5-6 years"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Primary reconstruction for bladder exstrophy is often delayed to 6 to 12 months to allow for growth and better surgical outcomes, though neonatal repair is also an option."
