        "A": "Genetic mutation alone",

      "explanation": "The predominant theory for colonic atresia development is a vascular accident during fetal development, with evidence supporting intrauterine vascular compromise as the primary mechanism."

      "question": "What is a key component of medical management preoperatively in colonic atresia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Oral feeding with breast milk",

        "C": "Prophylactic antibiotics alone",
        "D": "Immediate surgical intervention without preparation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Preoperative management focuses on nasogastric decompression to prevent aspiration and intravenous fluids for resuscitation, as patients often present with abdominal distension and vomiting."
