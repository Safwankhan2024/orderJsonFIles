      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A laryngeal cleft is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by an abnormal communication between the larynx and the pharynx/esophagus due to failed posterior cricoid fusion."

        "D": "Wart-like growths caused by HPV"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Subglottic stenosis is a narrowing of the airway at the level of the cricoid cartilage, the only complete cartilaginous ring in the airway."

        "D": "Failure of embryologic fusion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Acquired subglottic stenosis is primarily from endotracheal tube-induced injury leading to fibrosis."

        "C": "Down syndrome",
        "D": "VACTERL association"

    {
      "question": "A 6-month-old infant presents with recurrent episodes of croup-like symptoms and respiratory distress. On examination, you hear stridor that is both inspiratory and expiratory. What is the most characteristic physical finding for this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hoarseness",
        "B": "Biphasic stridor",
        "C": "Choking with feeds",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Symptoms of subglottic stenosis include biphasic stridor, recurrent croup, and respiratory distress. Biphasic stridor (both inspiratory and expiratory) is characteristic of subglottic stenosis, which occurs at the level of the cricoid cartilage."
