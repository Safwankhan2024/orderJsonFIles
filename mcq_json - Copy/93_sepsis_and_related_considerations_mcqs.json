      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The highest incidence of sepsis is in children under 1 year, particularly neonates."

    {
      "question": "In the pathogenesis of sepsis, what is the initial immunologic event that triggers the systemic inflammatory response?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)",
        "B": "Overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6",
        "C": "Invasion of pathogens through physical or immune barriers",
        "D": "Endothelial injury leading to capillary leak"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The initial step in sepsis pathogenesis involves recognition of PAMPs by PRRs on immune cells, which then triggers downstream inflammatory cascades including cytokine release."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a pediatric patient with suspected sepsis, which of the following vital sign abnormalities is typically considered a late finding?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Tachycardia",
        "B": "Tachypnea",
        "C": "Hypotension",
        "D": "Altered mental status"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Hypotension is often a late sign in pediatric sepsis, as children can maintain blood pressure through compensatory mechanisms until late in the disease process."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the typical positivity rate of blood cultures in sepsis cases?",
      "options": {
        "A": "20-30%",

        "D": "80-90%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Blood cultures are positive in approximately 20-30% of sepsis cases."
    },
    {
      "question": "For what purpose is a chest X-ray primarily used in the evaluation of sepsis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To identify abdominal abscesses",
        "B": "To detect osteomyelitis",
        "C": "To identify a pulmonary source such as infiltrates or effusion",
        "D": "To assess neurological involvement"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Chest X-ray is used to identify a pulmonary source, including infiltrates or effusion."

    {
      "question": "According to current sepsis management guidelines, what is the recommended timeframe for administering broad-spectrum antibiotics in a pediatric patient with suspected sepsis and signs of organ dysfunction?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Within 24 hours of presentation",
        "B": "Within 1 hour of recognition",
        "C": "After blood culture results are available",
        "D": "Within 3 hours of triage"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour of recognition of sepsis with organ dysfunction to improve outcomes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary indication for surgical intervention in sepsis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To administer antibiotics",
        "B": "For fluid resuscitation",
        "C": "Definitive source control when a drainable focus is identified",
        "D": "To monitor vital signs"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Surgical management is indicated for definitive source control when a drainable focus of infection is identified."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a recognized complication of severe sepsis in pediatric patients?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hypertension requiring treatment",
        "B": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)",
        "C": "Improved neutrophil function",
        "D": "Decreased C-reactive protein levels"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Complications of sepsis include septic shock, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key prevention strategy for sepsis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Avoiding all physical activity",
        "B": "Adherence to vaccination schedules",
        "C": "Using antibiotics prophylactically in all children",
        "D": "Limiting fluid intake"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Prevention strategies include adherence to vaccination schedules, strict hand hygiene, and central line bundles in hospitals."

        "D": "Decreased C-reactive protein levels"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "ARDS is a serious pulmonary complication of sepsis resulting from inflammatory-mediated damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to hypoxemic respiratory failure."
