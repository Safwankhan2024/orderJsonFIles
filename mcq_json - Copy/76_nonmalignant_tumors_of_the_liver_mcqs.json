      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Surgical resection is typically recommended for hepatocellular adenomas >5 cm due to increased risk of hemorrhage and malignant transformation. Resection is also generally advised for all HCAs in male patients and for β-catenin–activated subtypes regardless of size, but among the listed options, lesion size >5 cm is the best single indication."
