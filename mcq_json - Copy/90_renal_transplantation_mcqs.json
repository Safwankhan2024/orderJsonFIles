      "question": "In pediatric renal transplantation, what is the typical age range for peak incidence due to conditions like congenital anomalies and glomerular diseases?",
      "options": {
        "A": "0–4 years",
        "B": "5–11 years",
        "C": "12–18 years",
        "D": "Over 18 years"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Adolescence (12–18 years) shows a peak incidence for transplantation, often from congenital anomalies (e.g., CAKUT) and glomerular diseases like FSGS."
