      "question": "In pediatric intussusception, which of the following is the most common pathological lead point that triggers disproportionate peristalsis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Viral infection causing lymphoid hyperplasia",
        "B": "Meckel's diverticulum",
        "C": "Intestinal polyp",
        "D": "Lymphoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In children, the most common lead point is hypertrophied Peyer's patches secondary to viral infections, particularly adenovirus, which accounts for approximately 90% of idiopathic cases. Other triggers include Meckel's diverticulum, polyps, lymphoma, and Henoch-Schönlein purpura, but these are less common."

      "question": "What is the sensitivity of ultrasound in diagnosing intussusception?",
      "options": {
        "A": "75-85%",
        "B": "88-100%",
        "C": "97-100%",
        "D": "50-60%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Ultrasound has a sensitivity of 97-100% for diagnosing intussusception."
    },
    {
      "question": "What principle best describes the urgency required in managing intussusception?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Delayed intervention allows for better planning",
        "B": "Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to preserve bowel viability",
        "C": "Conservative management should always be attempted first",
        "D": "Surgical consultation can wait until imaging is complete"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Intussusception requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent bowel ischemia, necrosis, and perforation, with outcomes directly related to time from symptom onset to intervention. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical, summarized as 'Time is bowel'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a component of the initial medical management for a child with suspected intussusception?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Immediate surgical consultation",
        "B": "Fluid resuscitation and stabilization",
        "C": "Starting chemotherapy",
        "D": "Administering radiation therapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Initial management focuses on resuscitation with intravenous fluids, nasogastric decompression if obstructed, and analgesia, followed by prompt diagnostic imaging and consideration of non-operative reduction."

      "question": "What is the risk of perforation during enema reduction?",

      "question": "When does recurrence typically occur in most cases?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Within 24 hours",
        "B": "Within 72 hours",
        "C": "After 1 week",
        "D": "After 1 month"
