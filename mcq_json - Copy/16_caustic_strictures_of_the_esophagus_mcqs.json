    {
      "question": "Which type of caustic substance is most commonly associated with severe esophageal strictures?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Acids",
        "B": "Alkalis",
        "C": "Bleaches",
        "D": "Alcohol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Alkalis are the most common and severe cause of caustic esophageal strictures, leading to liquefactive necrosis that penetrates deeply into tissues."
    },
    {
      "question": "During which time frame does stricture formation typically occur after caustic ingestion?",
      "options": {
        "A": "1-2 weeks",
        "B": "3-8 weeks",
        "C": "6-12 months",
        "D": "Immediately after ingestion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Stricture formation typically occurs 3-8 weeks post-ingestion due to uncontrolled collagen synthesis and cross-linking."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key histopathological finding in caustic esophageal strictures?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Neoplastic cell proliferation",
        "B": "Dense collagen bundles in the submucosa and muscularis propria",
        "C": "Viral inclusion bodies",
        "D": "Amyloid deposits"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Histopathology reveals dense collagen bundles in the submucosa and muscularis propria, along with chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the first-line imaging modality for evaluating esophageal strictures?",
      "options": {
        "A": "CT scan with contrast",
        "B": "MRI",
        "C": "Esophagogram (Barium Swallow)",
        "D": "Ultrasound"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Esophagogram (Barium Swallow) is the first-line imaging modality, revealing the location, length, number, and degree of strictures."
    },
  {
      "question": "According to current ESPGHAN guidelines, what is the recommendation for routine corticosteroid use in acute caustic ingestion?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Routine use is recommended for all grades of injury",
        "B": "No significant benefit, so not recommended routinely",
        "C": "Only for Grade 3 injuries on endoscopy",
        "D": "Must be combined with proton pump inhibitors"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The 2020 ESPGHAN guidelines recommend against routine corticosteroid use, as evidence shows no significant benefit in reducing stricture formation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which cytokine is a key driver of the fibrotic process in caustic stricture pathogenesis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1)",
        "B": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6)",
        "C": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α)",
        "D": "Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β1)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β1) is a key cytokine driving the fibrotic process in caustic stricture pathogenesis."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the success rate for oral feeding after gastric transposition (gastric pull-up) surgery?",
      "options": {
        "A": ">70%",
        "B": ">80%",
        "C": ">90%",
        "D": "100%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Success rates for oral feeding after gastric transposition are greater than 90%."
