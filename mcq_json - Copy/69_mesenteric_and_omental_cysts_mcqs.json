      "question": "What is the primary etiology of mesenteric and omental cysts?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bacterial or viral infections",
        "B": "Developmental malformations of lymphatic vessels",
        "C": "Traumatic injury to abdominal structures",
        "D": "Environmental toxin exposure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The etiology involves developmental malformations of lymphatic vessels, failure of lymphatic channels to connect with the venous system, or abnormal lymphatic tissue sequestration during embryogenesis."

      "question": "At what age are most mesenteric and omental cysts diagnosed?",
      "options": {
        "A": "During adolescence",
        "B": "In adulthood",
        "C": "Before age 5 years",
        "D": "At birth"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "60% of mesenteric and omental cysts are diagnosed before age 5 years."

      "question": "What is a classic physical examination finding for mesenteric cysts?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Fixed, tender mass in the epigastrium",
        "B": "Mobile, nontender abdominal mass",
        "C": "Pulsatile mass with bruit",
        "D": "No palpable mass"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A mobile, nontender abdominal mass is a classic finding, and it may move perpendicular to the mesenteric attachment (Tillaux sign)."

    {
      "question": "What is the first-line imaging modality for mesenteric and omental cysts?",
      "options": {
        "A": "CT scan",
        "B": "MRI",
        "C": "Ultrasound",
        "D": "Plain X-ray"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality, showing an anechoic, thin-walled cystic structure with septations and acoustic enhancement."

      "question": "What is the recurrence rate after complete surgical excision of mesenteric and omental cysts?",
      "options": {
        "A": "20-30%",
        "B": "40-60%",
        "C": "0-6%",
        "D": "8-15%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The recurrence rate is 0-6% with complete surgical excision, compared to 40-60% with incomplete excision."

      "question": "What is the recommended follow-up protocol after surgical excision?",
      "options": {
        "A": "No follow-up needed",
        "B": "Annual MRI for 5 years",
        "C": "Clinical examination at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year with ultrasound at 6-12 months",
        "D": "Monthly blood tests for one year"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Follow-up includes clinical examination at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year, with ultrasound at 6-12 months to assess for recurrence, and no long-term follow-up needed after 1 year if asymptomatic."
