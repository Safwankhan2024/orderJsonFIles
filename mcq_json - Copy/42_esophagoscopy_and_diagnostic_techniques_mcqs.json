      "question": "What is a key advantage of diagnostic esophagoscopy over radiographic studies?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It is less invasive",
        "B": "It provides superior mucosal visualization and enables histological confirmation via biopsy",
        "C": "It does not require sedation",
        "D": "It is faster to perform"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Diagnostic esophagoscopy provides superior mucosal visualization compared to radiographic studies and enables histological confirmation via biopsy, which is the gold standard for diagnosing conditions like eosinophilic esophagitis."
