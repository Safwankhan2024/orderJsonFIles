      "question": "What is a ranula?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A malignant tumor of the salivary gland",
        "B": "A benign mucus extravasation cyst from sublingual gland duct disruption",
        "C": "An infectious cyst caused by bacteria",
        "D": "A congenital anomaly of the parotid gland"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A ranula is a benign mucus extravasation cyst resulting from disruption or obstruction of the sublingual gland duct."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are ranulas typically classified?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Simple and plunging",
        "B": "Acute and chronic",
        "C": "Infectious and non-infectious",
        "D": "Superficial and deep"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Ranulas are classified as simple (confined to the sublingual space) or plunging (extending into the neck)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary cause of ranulas?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Viral infection",
        "B": "Genetic mutations",
        "C": "Trauma or obstruction of the sublingual gland duct",
        "D": "Autoimmune disorders"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Ranulas are caused by trauma or obstruction of the sublingual gland duct, leading to mucus extravasation into the connective tissues."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the sequence of events in ranula pathogenesis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Infection → inflammation → cyst formation",
        "B": "Ductal rupture → mucus extravasation → inflammatory response → cystic cavity",
        "C": "Genetic mutation → abnormal growth → cyst",
        "D": "Obstruction → epithelial proliferation → cyst"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pathogenesis involves ductal rupture or obstruction → mucus extravasation into submucosal tissues → inflammatory response and granulation tissue formation → cystic cavity without epithelial lining."
    },
    {
      "question": "What histological feature distinguishes a ranula from a true cyst?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Presence of epithelial lining",
        "B": "Absence of epithelial lining",
        "C": "High vascularity",
        "D": "Calcifications"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Histologically, ranulas show an absence of epithelial lining, which distinguishes them from true cysts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What functional derangement can a large ranula cause?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hypertension",
        "B": "Mass effect leading to dysphagia or speech difficulties",
        "C": "Hormonal imbalances",
        "D": "Neurological deficits"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Functional derangements include mass effect causing dysphagia, speech difficulties, or airway compromise in large lesions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the recurrence rate of ranulas after marsupialization?",
      "options": {
        "A": "5-10%",
        "B": "20-30%",
        "C": "40-60%",
        "D": "70-80%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Recurrence can be up to 20–30% with marsupialization alone."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which condition is differentiated from ranula by being multiloculated on imaging?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Dermoid cyst",
        "B": "Lymphatic malformation",
        "C": "Sialadenitis",
        "D": "Pleomorphic adenoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Lymphatic malformation is multiloculated on imaging, unlike ranulas."
