        "A": "CFTR",
        "B": "RET",
        "C": "EDNRB",
        "D": "EDN3"
      },

      "question": "Which of the following is the most common early complication of intestinal stomas in pediatric patients?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Stoma prolapse",
        "B": "Peristomal skin excoriation",
        "C": "Parastomal hernia",
        "D": "Stoma necrosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Peristomal skin excoriation occurs in approximately 40% of pediatric stoma patients due to enzymatic irritation from effluent, making it the most frequent early complication."

      "question": "What is the typical time frame for stoma closure after initial creation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "1-2 weeks",
        "B": "8 weeks to 6 months",
        "C": "1 year",
        "D": "2 years"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Stoma closure is typically performed 8 weeks to 6 months after initial creation, depending on the patient's condition."

      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a contrast enema prior to stoma closure?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To diagnose NEC",
        "B": "To assess bowel gas pattern",
        "C": "To define anatomy and rule out distal obstruction",
        "D": "To measure stoma output"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Contrast enema helps define distal bowel anatomy, rule out obstruction (e.g., stricture, atresia), and ensure safe surgical planning for stoma closure."
