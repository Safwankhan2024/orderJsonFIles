P is for posterior Fossa malformations: Abnormalities in the back part of the brain, like Dandy-Walker cysts or cerebellar hypoplasia. H is for Hemangioma: A large, segmental vascular tumor (strawberry mark) usually on the face, scalp, or neck. A is for Arterial anomalies: Malformations of arteries in the head, neck, or brain. C is for Cardiac defects/Coarctation of the aorta: Heart problems or narrowing of the main artery (aorta). E is for Eye anomalies: Issues like strabismus (crossed eyes), optic nerve anomalies, or glaucoma. S is for Sternal defects: Problems with the breastbone, such as a sternal cleft. "
