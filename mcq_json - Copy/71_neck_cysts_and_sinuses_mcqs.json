        "D": "Fourth branchial cleft"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",

        "D": "It becomes painful"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A dermoid cyst typically does not move with tongue protrusion, which helps differentiate it from a thyroglossal duct cyst."

      "question": "Why are thyroid function tests recommended preoperatively for Thyroglossal Duct Cyst?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To assess for infection",
